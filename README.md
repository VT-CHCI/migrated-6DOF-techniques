# Migrated 6DOF techniques

This research project is to explore how 6DOF techniques could be migrated to the kinect or move. It is implimented in Vizard using a beta version of the Kinect SDK. It needs to be updated to run on current versions of the Kinect/Move SDK.


Originally this wasn't under version control so there are multiple copies of files. The last version should be the most up-to-date.
